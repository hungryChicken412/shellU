It's an efficient algorithm for sorting small number of elements.
it's WCT is - O(n^2)

It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as
merge sort, heap sort, quicksort.

pseudocode
----------------------------
for j = 2 to A.length:
	key = A[j]
	i = j - 1
	while i > 0 and A[i] > key:
		A[i+1] = A[i]
		i = i-1
	A[i+1] = key
